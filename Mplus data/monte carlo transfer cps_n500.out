  TITLE:	Monte Carlo Simulation
          for Transfer Effect
          of Intervention on Complex Problem Solving
  Assumptions:
  - Intraclass correlation coefficient about .10:
    The variance between classrooms makes up
    about 10% of the whole variance after the intervention
    (about 8% before intervention,
     1% due to intervention,
     1% due to non-controllable factors)
  - Posttest variance within classrooms:
    80% explained by pretest (retest-reliability)
    20% left unexplained
  - Posttest variance between classrooms:
    about 80% explained by pretest
    about 5% explained by est: Experimentaion Skills Training
    about 5% explained by mint: MINT Curriculum
    about 10% left unexplained due to non-controllable factors
  - 10% Missing data on posttest
  - Class sizes vary from 10 t0 30 children per class,
    with more classes in the middle range (15-25 children)
