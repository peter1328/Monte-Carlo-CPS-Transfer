TITLE:	Monte Carlo Simulation
for Transfer Effect
of Intervention on Complex Problem Solving
Assumptions:
- Intraclass correlation coefficient = .20
- Pretest explains 89% of between classroom variance at posttest
- Intervention explains 10% of between classroom variance at posttest
- 5% between classroom variance left unexplained at posttest
- 5% Missing data on posttest

  		nobservations = 500000;
  		ncsizes = 1;
        ! Classroom sample: Overall 40 Classrooms with 10 - 30 children
  		csizes = 5(100000); ! Number and size of the 40 classrooms
        ! Define intervention variable (>.5 = intervention group; see 2010 Mediation-article)
        cutpoints = est (.5) mint (.5);
        ! Define missing values
        PATMISS = post (.10); ! 10% of posttest-data on Complex Problem Solving are missing
  		PATPROBS = 1;
        ! Define seed for quasi-random number generation
        seed = 667;
        ! Define number of Monte Carlo draws from the population
  		nreps = 1;
        ! Define variables on second level (school class level)
          between = est mint; ! The interventions happen on the classroom level
        !save = MCTransfer_*.dat; ! Activate to save sampled data
        !repsave = all;         ! Activate to save sampled data
